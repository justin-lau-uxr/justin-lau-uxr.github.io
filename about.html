				<p class="about-image-description">I'm currently the sole UX Researcher on CIBC's Enterprise Innovation team, a small yet might interdisciplinary team of innovation strategists, designers, and researchers focused on articulating business challenges and arriving at solutions through a collaborative design thinking approach. We work in an agile manner, supporting businesses via dedicated sprints, workshops, and townhall activities that inspire a "people-first" mindset while moving fast, and getting sh*t done.</p>

				<h5>Some fun things I've been up to recently:</h5>
				<p>&#x1f3c6 In 2021 I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justinlau1997_we-are-ecstatic-to-announce-the-winning-teams-activity-6770374206707384321-UG4m" target="blank">won an award</a> at the first hackathon I’ve ever attended. To date, I've now mentored for 5 hackathons, with 2 of those having mentored teams that won awards.</p>
				<p>&#127918 I’m ranked in the <a href="https://lolchess.gg/profile/na/kyuubiknight" target="blank">top 1000 TFT players</a> in North America.</p>
				<p>&#128378 I danced with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/unitydanceco/?hl=en" target="blank">Unity Dance Co.</a> from September 2019 to January 2020.</p>
				
				<h5>A little more about me</h5>
				
				<p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve always been a super curious person. This drive for wanting to learn more is one of the main reasons I got interested in the world of UX. I love learning about people; the way they work, live, play, and interact with the things in their everyday lives. This curiosity of wanting to know “what makes someone tick”, and never being afraid to ask why, is what sparked my interest specifically in UX research. Through my work experience I’m also learning what it means to advocate for UXR, and what it takes to help build a team that understands the necessity of research, and is confident in their ability to conduct, interpret, and synthesize UXR to produce data-driven design decisions. Everyday I get to enjoy this process of learning, unlearning, and relearning, and it’s helped shape me into the person I am today!</p>

				<!-- <p>Some industries that I'm currently interested in are Financial literacy/FinTech, and UX for game design.</p> -->
