			<h4>Project Overview</h4>
			<p>Partnering with CIBC's life insurance business, my focus was on optimizing the end-to-end life insurance policy buying experience, and I spearheaded the effort by <span class="bold">developing the research plan, executing research methodologies, and synthesizing findings into a report tailored to executive audiences</span>. Collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders, from product to legal, I co-created innovative solutions using insights from market research, user research, and design thinking workshops. My efforts culminated in pitching findings to high-level stakeholders, ranging from Vice Presidents to C-suite, that resulted in driving strategic business decisions.</p>
			<p>Overall, two surveys, and 2 rounds of usability tests were conducted over a 4 month period.</p>

			<h5>The Challenge: Reimagine the digital end-to-end Life Insurance quote and purchasing experience.</h5>

		</div>

		<div class="col-8of8 center" id="objectives">
			<h4>Research Objectives</h4>
			<p>The User Experience Research plan for this engagement revolved around 3 key milestones:</p>
			
			<div class="col-5of8 indent">
				<h5>Milestone 1 (Generative):</h5>
				<p>Getting a general view of Canadians’ perspective about life insurance.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-5of8 indent">
				<h5>Milestone 2 (Evaluative):</h5>
				<p>Evaluate the current state CIBC experience of searching for life insurance, navigating the website, and obtaining a quote.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-5of8 indent">
				<h5>Milestone 3 (Evaluative):</h5>
				<p>Compare the proposed experience with the current experience based on usability, support, and likelihood to apply for a quote.</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		
		<div class="center flex-container milestone1" id="milestone1">
			<div class="col-5of8">
				<h4>Milestone 1: Understanding users</h4>
				<p>When the Life Insurance team came to us, they didn’t have any artifacts for us to reference in regards to the target segment for the business. As such, a key outcome of this engagement was to create foundational artifacts for the Life Insurance business, such as personas and journey maps. </p>

				<h5>Why a survey</h5>
				<p>Reach a <span class="bold">large audience quickly</span> to inform persona creation, focusing on <span class="bold">communication preferences, experience expectations, and overall perceptions of life insurance.</span></p>
				

				<h5>What we learned</h5>
				<p>Overall, we learned that Canadians feel they are <span class="bold">somewhat confident</span> with their life insurance knowledge. They think the most important information to know is the <span class="bold">specific benefits</span> they can realize if they were to get a life insurance policy.</p>
				<p>Most preferred format for education about life insurance is through online articles or videos where they can <span class="bold">learn at their own pace.</span></p>

			<h4>Guiding principles moving forward</h4>
			<p>Based on the findings from the survey, I identified guiding principles for the team to ground ourselves in as we worked towards designing the ideal future state. Additionally, I used these key learnings to begin informing the usability testing plan to validate the accuracy of these findings.</p>

				<h4>Milestone 2: Evaluating current state</h4>
				<p>In this milestone, our goal was to evaluate the current state experience of getting a quote and applying for a policy. To accomplish this, I decided <span class="bold">unmoderated usability testing</span> would be a suitable methodology because it would allow us to <span class="bold">unobtrusively observe</span> users in a realistic setting, and because it was a live site, I didn't have to worry about participants being stuck with the potential technical difficulties of using a prototype.</p>

				<h5>Our goal was to observe how people:</h5>
				<div class="indent">
					<p><span class="bold">Search</span> for cibc life insurance.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					<p><span class="bold">Arrive</span> at the life insurance page.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="indent">
					<p><span class="bold">Complete</span> the quote obtaining experience.</p>

						<p>The reason I recruited participants who do not currenlty have a life insurance policy is because I wanted to get to know the experience of someone who has presumably never explored life insurance before.

			<h4>Usability testing plan</h4>
			<p>Participants were given a scenario to imagine themselves in and set the context for the session.</p>
			<p>The main prompt was:</p>
			<blockquote class="usability-testing-prompt">
				<p>"“Imagine your goal is to get a life insurance quote from CIBC. You want to know which life insurance policy will best suit your needs, why that policy is suitable for you, and how much it will cost (per month and in total)."</p>
			</blockquote>
			
			<a href="images/cibc-life-insurance/usability-testing.jpg" target="blank"><img src="images/cibc-life-insurance/usability-testing.jpg" alt="Image of screenshot from usability testing session." class="col-8of8"></a>
			<figcaption>Participants were also prompted to use the think-aloud method so that when the team watched the recordings back, we would get glimpses into the participant’s thought process, feelings, and reactions to the experience. </figcaption>

			<p class="increase-top-padding">After they had received a life insurance quote, they were then asked 6 follow up questions to learn more about their experience, evaluate if they were able to find key information, and learn about their expectations for next steps. Lastly, participants were then asked to fill out a SUS survey to quantitatively measure the perceived usability of the current state experience. Using this score I would then be able to compare it with the SUS score of the future state experience later.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="center col-8of8">
			<h4>What we learned</h4>
			<div class="flex-container">
				<div class="col-4of8">
					<h5>Overall, participants <span class="bold">said:</span></h5>
					<ul>
						<li>The current experience was <span class="bold">simple, easy, and intuitive.</span></li>
						<li><span class="bold">5 participants correctly guessed</span> that after they got the quote they would then be prompted to apply for the policy. The respondents who <span class="bold">didn’t guess correctly</span> thought they might receive an email receipt of the quote, or would be contacted by an agent to proceed with the application.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="col-4of8">
					<h5>And participants <span class="bold">actions</span> showed us:</h5>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="bold">All 10 participants</span> were able to find the support contact information if they ran into any issues or needed help getting a quote.</li>
						<li><span class="bold">7 participants</span> did not notice the coverage calculator tool, but <span class="bold">all 10</span> said they think such a tool would be useful.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

			<h4>Recommendations moving forward for design direction</h4>
			<p>Based on these findings, my top 3 recommendations for the design team focused on:</p>

			<div class="col-5of8">
				<h4>Milestone 3: Comparing the current and future state experience</h4>
				<p>In this final milestone, the goal was to compare how users felt about the current versus proposed future state experience of getting a life insurance quote. The approach I took was two-fold:</p>

				<h5>Method 1: A/B survey testing</h5>
				<p>Reach a <span class="bold">large audience quickly</span> and <span class="bold">quantitatively</span> measure which qualities of the two designs had the most impact on respondent preference. The key qualities presented to respondents were divided into <span class="bold">visual appeal</span> or <span class="bold">clarity of content.</span></p>
				

				<h5>Method 2: A/B unmoderated usability testing</h5>
				<p>Uncover <span class="bold">qualitative findings</span> comparing the usability of the current and future state experiences. To facilitate the A/B test, I turned the current live site into a Figma prototype to control the <span class="bold">medium bias</span> they might experience by going from a live site to a prototype (or vice versa). Additionally, usability testing participants were shown the prototypes in an alternating pattern (AB or BA) to address potential <span class="bold">order bias</span>. This helps to ensure that any differences in the results are due to the variables being tested and not due to the order in which they were presented.</p>

		<div class="center col-8of8">
			<h4>User Experience Considerations - What did users like?</h4>
			<p>The results from both methods indicated that the <span class="bold">majority</span> of usability testing participants and survey respondents <span class="bold">preferred the proposed experience</span>. When we uncovered why, three key themes emerged:</p>
			<div class="flex-container">
				<div class="col-2of8 guiding-principles">
					<img src="images/cibc-life-insurance/icons/optionality.png" alt="Scroll icon" class="col-1of2">
					<h5>Optionality</h5>
					<p>People liked the future state experience because they were presented with <span class="bold">recommended</span> life insurance policies. They liked that they were given just enough options to <span class="bold">not feel overwhelmed</span>, but also felt that they were <span class="bold">not forced or pressured</span> to sign up for a policy at that very moment.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-2of8 guiding-principles">
					<img src="images/cibc-life-insurance/icons/heart-bubble.png" alt="Scroll icon" class="col-1of2">
					<h5>Visual appeal</h5>
					<p>Both groups also liked that the information in the future state experience was displayed in a way that was <span class="bold">visually pleasing</span>. The categorization of the information, clear headers that separated chunks of content, and use of diverse multimedia (videos, icons, buttons, tabs) made the content <span class="bold">easier to digest.</span></p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-2of8 guiding-principles">
					<img src="images/cibc-life-insurance/icons/hourglass.png" alt="Scroll icon" class="col-1of2">
					<h5>Quicker experience</h5>
					<p>Usability testing participants also said that the future state experience felt easier because it <span class="bold">required less clicks</span> to get to their end goal of receiving a quote. This is supported by the fact that the design team was able to reduce the experience from <span class="bold">6 steps down to 3.</span></p>

		<div class="col-8of8 center" id="reflection">
			<h4>Metrics to measure the success of our proposal</h4>
			<p>Although I am unable to present quantitative metrics at this time, the project's success can be contributed to the fact that other life insurance products, such as Accident Protection Plan and Guaranteed Acceptance Life Insurance, have also been updated following our recommendation. In order to evaluate the success of our project, some key metrics that I would look for include: change in conversion rate, time spent on specific pages of the site, and heat maps for where users are clicking the most.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-8of8 center">
			<h4>Strengthening my research planning and rationale</h4>
			<p>Reflecting on this project emphasizes the importance of having a clearly defined research plan upfront and signed off by stakeholders early in the process. During the executive showcase, an executive audience member had asked questions about how and why we recruited participants for the usability testing, and questioning the statistical significance of our findings. Since I had received alignment from our project sponsors early on, I was able to confidently explain the rationale, and our Life Insurance partners also chimed in with their support.</p>
